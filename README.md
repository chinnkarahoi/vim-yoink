## Yoink

This is just another killring style vim plugin similar to [nvim-miniyank](https://github.com/bfredl/nvim-miniyank), [YankRing.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/YankRing.vim), [vim-yankstack](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vim-yankstack) or the yank features in [vim-easyclip](https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-easyclip).
